Here is an example of a Python Flask API code that can be used to implement the Comprehensive Applicant Notification System:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/submit_application', methods=['POST'])
def submit_application():
    # Process loan application submission
    # Send notification to applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan application submitted successfully'})

@app.route('/update_status', methods=['POST'])
def update_status():
    # Process application status update
    # Send notification to applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Application status updated'})

@app.route('/send_loan_offer', methods=['POST'])
def send_loan_offer():
    # Process loan offer details
    # Send notification to applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Loan offer sent'})

@app.route('/disbursement_update', methods=['POST'])
def disbursement_update():
    # Process disbursement update
    # Send notification to applicant
    # Return success response
    return jsonify({'message': 'Disbursement update sent'})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This code defines four routes: `/submit_application`, `/update_status`, `/send_loan_offer`, and `/disbursement_update`. Each route corresponds to a specific action in the user story.

To implement the complete system, you would need to integrate this Flask API code with the loan application system, implement the logic for sending notifications via the preferred method of communication, and ensure compliance with data protection and privacy regulations. Additionally, you would need to implement the user interface for selecting the preferred notification method and handle the dependencies on external services such as email, SMS, or push notification providers.

Please note that this is a basic example and you would need to customize and extend the code according to your specific requirements and the technologies you are using.
